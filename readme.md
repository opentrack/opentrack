Open Track
===========

Modular headtracking program that supports multiple face-trackers, filters and game-protocols. Among the trackers are the SM FaceAPI, AIC Inertial Head Tracker and PointTracker (IR-tracker derived from FreeTrack). Movements of the head are registered by a simple web cam: no additional hardware is required!
